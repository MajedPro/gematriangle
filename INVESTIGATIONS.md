T17 has 153 counters
T52 has 153 perimeter
Are these linked? COGs? Areas?

T42 and Matt 1:1

When you colour the centered triangle counters on T37 and T73 using Pascal values ... the uncoloured counters on both Ts have a value that is divisible by 37 and 73 and thus 2701

T73 center dot value on Pascal - T37 center dot value on Pascal!
