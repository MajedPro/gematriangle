MAJOR TODOs
===========

Code triangle buttons and Star of David
Code three button with modal
fill mode
list of triangles



Check PI is accurate
Tidy number data

Alert bible verses?
Highlight dots with special numbers attached?

Fixed footer showing how many of each color are selected

Activate dropdown only in line mode - maybe select dropdown too for some mode?

Moving actives

Actives should spin and be bigger?

Fix page load

Select counters with values that are a multiple of X with offset Y

One third points (like midpoints)? these are Hexagon points?

Triangle list - button takes you to it - click through to specific triangle

Size button - large size shows values on counters

Fullscreen and opposite - noun project fullscreen

Save

Numbers calculator

Comment box

good way to sync active counters - remove class and add on 2 secs

hide numbers when spinning? or stop numbers spinning?

multiple values selector - e.g. gen1v1 + pi + pascal OR gen1v1 * ordinal * pi - etc

activate all counters with val X

SUM individual digits option - once or repeat until one digit

Alerts min number

Alerts stop repeating same one when triangle resized or something! also no repeat for 1 min for low priority alerts

Fix 5 pointed star to use Star of David

If draw lines clicked twice - e.g. nothing to do then erase (still need erase button)
