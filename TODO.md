Think about diff modes for Hebrew letters - off ordinal and std - maybe a tav which has diff values not alef? - other mode for Hebrew letter is numbers as they appear in bible

ESD scanner - look for Yeshua
find all hebrew letters in word Elohim
color certain number only
prime or prime factors
faded-layer - work on it as normal and when fade it values become 0 but it remains faded in bg
can faded layer be diff size or shape to main layer - yes would be nice but then how do you center it
triangle colour buttons should color all and points and perim
toFixed on all display numbers
show Hebrew letters - for any value group
make numbers in list non clickable
layers
Remove constants and replace with Links and videos - 1 or 2 main gem videos + video on Psalm 86
Analyser/scanner - checks for things in background - e.g. a sequence of numbers - with or without ESD
How would Fibonacci or Padovan sequence be used?
Paint every counter whose value is .. a multiple of CT37 (number here) .. with offset AND every counter whose value is ... a multiple of PAD37 (number here) with offset ... AND ... etc
Supported sequences - S, ST, T, CT, P, PAD, F

Modes should be tabs not buttons
LIST OF ALL BIBLE CHAPTERS, DO THEY HAVE ODD OR EVEN LETTER COUNT?
GEN 1:1 - use letter values to form other values - e.g. word values, think of values used to make PI from Gen 1:1
Check PI and all data is accurate - add more to Gen1v1 - add John 1v1 (std and ordinal) - constant e - golden ratio
Undo / Redo

GOTTA BE DONE
=============

Help - e.g. What does flipped mean, info on list, what does offset mean, what does the spider web thing mean
Fill mode same as paint mode?
Save
Re-enable alerting
Alerts min number
Alerts stop repeating same one when triangle resized or something! also no repeat for 1 min for low priority alerts?
Alerts - tidy number data
One third points (like midpoints)? these are Hexagon points?
All data in one folder

MAYBES
======

Active areas ... e.g. color even dots in active area only?
Line drawing for RA triangle?
Efficiency (allows higher T numbers)
Active patterns - e.g. patterns grow as you grow the triangle
Print
Save
Pick color
Good way to sync active counters - remove class and add on 2 secs - not spinning in unison and not spinning centrally - see Sierpinski odd even activations - possibly bigger ones are central
Add more colors - footer increases in size if more than 6 colors? will footer overlap?
Custom colors?
When triangle size down and then back up, should remember removed rows?
Save triangle on refresh?
Moving actives?
Alert bible verses?
Highlight dots with special numbers attached?
Actives should be bigger?
Numbers calculator
Comment box
hide numbers when spinning? or stop numbers spinning?
multiple values selector - e.g. gen1v1 + pi + pascal OR gen1v1 * ordinal * pi - etc
activate all counters with val X
SUM individual digits option - once or repeat until one digit
Fill cursors - and other cursors

REQUIRES BE
